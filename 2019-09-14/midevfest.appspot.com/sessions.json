      "description": "Almost every thriving organization needs a variety of successful role players. A rational developer wants the sales person to succeed, not to mention the PMs, marketing, etc. If a PM or client manager is mixing up the terms \"platform\" and \"framework\" in front of a more tech-savvy customer, it could be embarrassing. Marketing people may come back a number of times to ask similar questions about a process or system the company offers. \n\nThe answer to these potentially frustrating situations lies in communications skills that acknowledge a shared purpose and reality - which is simpler than that sounds. The ability to \"translate\" technical matters in to understandable language or concepts for non-techies is a less recognized but highly valued skill. Similarly, the non-techie that can articulate tech matters and be credible in their environment is also highly valued and is really good for the organization. \n\nIn this talk, Baxtresser will provide some guideposts for these interactions that will result in communications that are clearer and more meaningful which will benefit you, your non-technical co-worker, and your organization or customer. When a successful question or situation dialog is resolved and finishes with greater understanding and increased retention, there are positive effects downstream internally, as well as with customers and/or users. Those good results will enable a greater degree of trust and respect in the professional relationship and in the organization.\n",

Even if you suggest a tool to help them help you, they're unwilling to learn and set in their process.\n\nAdobe XD exports assets in a way that developers can use right away. The best part is that it already integrates with the Creative Suite products that designers already use, making it much more likely they'll actually use it.
